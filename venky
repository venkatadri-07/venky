BookNest: Where Stories Nestle
A cozy digital space where book lovers can discover, collect, and celebrate stories — just like birds nestle their treasures.

📝 Project Description
BookNest is a web-based application aimed at readers who want to manage their reading life digitally. From discovering books and reading reviews to organizing personal reading lists, BookNest provides a welcoming environment for every reader. Think of it as a virtual “nest” where your favorite books live.

It combines features of a book catalog, personal bookshelf, and community discussion platform — all in one.

To provide a platform where users can write reviews, rate books, and track their reading progress.

To foster a community-driven book ecosystem where users interact via comments, likes, and recommendations.

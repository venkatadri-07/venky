OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

BookNest is a web-based platform designed for book lovers to explore, organize, and share their reading experiences. The name symbolizes a comforting digital "nest" where stories live, grow, and inspire.

In a world overflowing with content, BookNest offers a peaceful space where users can:

Discover books through integrated APIs (like Google Books),

Create personal collections called “Nests”,

Write and read book reviews,

Track reading progress with journaling tools,

And connect with a like-minded reading community.

Whether you're a casual reader, a student, or a passionate bibliophile, BookNest is designed to make your reading journey engaging and meaningful.

The project aims to combine the utility of a digital bookshelf with the warmth of a book club — all in one cozy, user-friendly platform.
